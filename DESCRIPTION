Description: One of the most challenging problems in computational biology
    is inference of active regulatory cascades under specific molecular and
    environmental perturbations. As our understanding of regulatory mechanisms
    grows, larger networks of causal and non-causal biological interactions become
    available. However, only a fraction of regulatory interactions are tagged as
    either increasing or decreasing a target transcript. This leads to networks
    with a mix of signed and unsigned interactions. In this package, we provide
    a statistical method (Quaternary Dot Product Scoring Statistic or simply the Quaternary 
    Statistic) that will infer likely upstream regulators given (1) a set of up- 
    and down-regulated transcripts from a specific biological experiment and (2) a 
    mixed network of regulatory interactions potentially relevant in the current biological 
    context.
